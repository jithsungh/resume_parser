# Section Extraction Enhancement Status

**Date**: 2025-10-21  
**Resumes Analyzed**: 272 total, 31 with blank Experience (11.4%)

---

## ✅ COMPLETED Enhancements

### 1. Multi-word Section Header Detection ✅

**Files Modified**:

- `src/core/section_splitter.py` (NEW)
- `src/PDF_pipeline/segment_sections.py`

**What It Does**:

- Detects when multiple section headers appear on same line
- Example: "EXPERIENCE SKILLS" → recognizes BOTH Experience and Skills
- Marks in Unknown Sections as `[MULTI-SECTION: Experience, Skills]`
- Helps identify multi-column layout issues

**Test Cases**:

```python
"EXPERIENCE SKILLS" → ["Experience", "Skills"]
"PROJECT HIGHLIGHT" → ["Projects"]
"GO DEVELOPER" → ["Experience"]  # Job title mapped to Experience
```

### 2. Typo & Variation Matching ✅

**Files Modified**:

- `config/sections_database.json`

**Added Variants** (total 44 new variants):

**Experience Section** (15 new):

- Typos: "experiance", "experien", "exeperience"
- Job titles: "react js developer", "go developer", "devops engineer", "aws devops engineer"
- Variations: "project highlight", "github link", "full stack developer"

**Improved Matching**:

- `_despaced()`: Removes all separators for matching
- Trailing colon handling: "EXPERIENCE:" → "EXPERIENCE"
- Case-insensitive: "ExPeRiEnCe" → "experience"

## ⚠️ PARTIALLY COMPLETED

### 3. Column Detection for Complex Layouts ⚠️

**Status**: Detection works, but column splitting not enhanced

**What Works**:

- Detects multi-section headers on same line
- Flags them in Unknown Sections
- Logs debug info when `SEG_DEBUG=1`

**What's Missing**:

- Doesn't automatically re-split columns
- Gnanasai_Dachiraju resume still shows: "EXPERIENCE SKILLS" as unknown
- Need to enhance `split_columns.py` histogram algorithm

**Solution Needed**:

```python
# When multi-section detected:
# 1. Analyze word positions in line
# 2. Determine likely column boundary
# 3. Split the line into separate section headers
# 4. Create separate sections for each
```

### 4. Section Learning ⚠️

**Status**: Persistence works, but not aggressive enough

**What Works**:

- Learning persists to `sections_database.json`
- `_add_section_variant()` saves immediately
- Embeddings available (if `SEG_ENABLE_EMBEDDINGS=1`)

**What's Missing**:

- Multi-section headers not automatically added to database
- Job titles detected but not learned
- No fuzzy matching threshold tuning

## 🔧 FIXES NEEDED

### Fix 1: Auto-learn from Multi-Section Headers

**Current**: Detects "GO DEVELOPER" → marks as unknown  
**Needed**: Detects "GO DEVELOPER" → learns as Experience variant → adds to database

**Implementation**:

```python
# In segment_sections.py, after multi-section detection:
if multi_sections_detected:
    for section_name in detected_sections:
        # Learn each detected section
        learner.add_variant(section_name, raw_text)
```

### Fix 2: Enhanced Column Splitting for Side-by-Side Headers

**Current**: "EXPERIENCE SKILLS" treated as single line  
**Needed**: Detect spatial separation, split into 2 column headers

**Implementation Strategy**:

1. Analyze word bounding boxes in the line
2. Detect significant X-coordinate gaps
3. Split line text at gap positions
4. Create separate section headers

### Fix 3: Aggressive Learning Mode

**Current**: Only learns when embeddings enabled  
**Needed**: Learn from patterns even without embeddings

**Add to `section_learner.py`**:

```python
def learn_from_patterns(self, text: str, context: dict) -> bool:
    """
    Learn from common patterns without embeddings:
    - Job titles → Experience
    - "... Developer" → Experience
    - "... Engineer" → Experience
    - "... Projects" → Projects
    """
```

## 📊 Results Summary

### Before Enhancements:

- 31 resumes with blank Experience (11.4%)
- "EXPERIENCE SKILLS" → Unknown
- "GO DEVELOPER" → Unknown
- "PROJECT HIGHLIGHT" → Unknown

### After Current Fixes:

- Multi-section headers DETECTED ✅
- Typos matched ✅
- 15+ new Experience variants ✅
- But still showing in Unknown Sections ⚠️

### After Remaining Fixes:

- Multi-section headers SPLIT and LEARNED
- Job titles automatically → Experience
- Complex layouts handled correctly
- Expected: <5% resumes with blank Experience

## 🎯 Action Items

### Priority 1: Complete Section Learning

1. ✅ Add job titles to Experience variants (DONE)
2. ⏳ Enable auto-learning from multi-section headers
3. ⏳ Add pattern-based learning (job titles, etc.)

### Priority 2: Enhance Column Detection

1. ⏳ Add word-position analysis to split_columns.py
2. ⏳ Detect side-by-side headers in same line
3. ⏳ Split multi-section lines based on X-coordinates

### Priority 3: Testing

1. ⏳ Re-process all 31 failing resumes
2. ⏳ Verify multi-section headers split correctly
3. ⏳ Check learning database grows automatically

---

## 🧪 How to Test

### Test Multi-Section Detection:

```bash
# Enable debug mode
export SEG_DEBUG=1

# Process a failing resume
python3 -m scripts.batch_folder_process --folder freshteams_resume/Resumes --output test_output.xlsx

# Check for "[MULTI-SECTION:" in Unknown Sections
python3 analyze_blank_experience.py
```

### Test Learning:

```bash
# Check database before
cat config/sections_database.json | grep "variants" | wc -l

# Process resumes with learning enabled
python3 -m scripts.batch_folder_process --folder freshteams_resume/Resumes

# Check database after (should have more variants)
cat config/sections_database.json | grep "variants" | wc -l
```

### Test Column Splitting:

```bash
# Process complex layout resume
python3 scripts/test_pipeline.py freshteams_resume/Resumes/Gnanasai_Dachiraju_Resume.pdf

# Check if Experience and Skills are separate sections
# Should NOT see "EXPERIENCE SKILLS" in Unknown Sections
```
