Title : GenAi.
Domain : Artificial Intelligence.
Role : Software Engineer.
Client : USA.
Description:
GenAI is a scalable backend platform built using Spring Boot that integrates with generative AI models
(e.g., OpenAI GPT, Claude) to automate content creation across domains such as customer support,
marketing, documentation, and internal tools. The system exposes secure RESTful endpoints for prompt
submission and returns AI-generated responses tailored to business needs.
Key Features & Architecture:
Modular Microservice Architecture: Designed using Spring Boot microservices with clear separation of
concerns-prompt processing, model interaction, caching, and analytics.
AI Integration Layer: Connected to OpenAI and other LLM providers via REST APIs, with support for
dynamic prompt templates and temperature tuning.
Prompt Orchestration: Implemented Lang Chain-like orchestration in Java to chain prompts, manage
context, and support multi-turn conversations.
Caching & Performance: Used Redis for caching frequent prompt responses and PostgreSQL for storing
prompt history and analytics.
Responsibilities :
? Developed and maintained RESTful APIs using Spring Boot to interact with OpenAI and other LLM providers.
? Implemented caching with Redis to optimize performance and reduce latency.
? Designed PostgreSQL schema to store prompt history, user preferences, and feedback.

Administrative Tools, and User Management. User requests start from the UI and are routing through
IBM ISAM for authentication and load balancing. After authentication, the Employer Orchestration
Service Layer on IBM WebSphere Liberty handles the business logic and directs requests to the
backend services. The Employer Microservices, also on IBM WebSphere Liberty, interact with the
IBM DB2 database to manage specific business tasks. A Redis server serves as a caching layer,
storing frequently accessed data in memory, which speeds up response times and reduces database
load. External services like FIX Services and GroupSearchService use SOAP/REST protocols
managed by DataPower. Auditing and logging are handled through AILS Web Services
for compliance.
